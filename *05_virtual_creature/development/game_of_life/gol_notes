Cellular Automata
-system of cells that exist in a grid (1D, 2D, 3D)

Game of Life
-cellular automata in 2D
-Generations
    -compute cells on a grid (generation 0)
    and generate new cells on the grid (generation 1)
-All cells have a state (GoL = two states)
    -0,1
    -on / off
    -alive / dead

-New state of cell based on state during previous generation
-and neighbours state during previous generation
-neighbours are 8 other cells surrounding a cell
-decided by the RULES - which are design to resemble a biological process

if cell is 0 (dead)
    -will change to 1 (alive) if 3 alive neighbours

if cell is 1 (alive)
    -will change to 0 (dead) unless it has
        < 2 alive neighbours
        or
        > 3 alive neighours

-Gives you the remainder of division

9 + 1 % 10 = 0

Variants:
-Make each cell an object
-Colours based on history of the system
-Allow user to draw with the mouse -to set cells on
-Create certain kinds of patterns
-Edges in a different way
-Average of floating point numbers rather than 0, 1
-Change rules / visualise system in a different way
